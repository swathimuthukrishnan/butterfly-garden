<h2>butterfly garden dubai</h2>
<p>Located right next to existing Dubai Miracle garden, Dubai Butterfly Garden claimed to be the “World’s Largest Covered Butterfly Garden” consists of ten custom built domes around 6,673 sq.m. Each dome is filled with thousands of beautifully winged creatures, featuring 15,000 butterflies of around over 50 varieties of butterfly in different sizes and colors flying around the visitors. Dubai Butterfly Garden gives you the opportunity to see how butterflies evolve through each stage.</p>
<p>It’s easy to while away a couple of hours in here as you wander through the different domes. If the children need a break, they can indulge in some tasty snacks – our tasty treats include nachos, popcorn and gelato, while there’s also fresh fruit juices – while taking in a movie in our theatre. Explore the Butterfly Museum to discover stunning artworks created using real butterflies by our talented in-house artisans. Want to take home a special butterfly souvenir? We’ve got a store for that located right by the museum at the garden’s entrance  </p>
<p>We offer special packages and rates for hosting birthdays your kids are sure never to forget. But this place isn’t only an ideal option for little ones. We’ve also hosted a number of corporate events with a fun twist here at Dubai Butterfly Garden. Get in touch with our team to learn how you can put together a product launch far more memorable than the usual hotel ballroom affair.

    Dubai Butterfly Garden is easy to access from Mohammed Bin Zayed, Umm Suqeim and Al Khail roads, and there is a direct bus that comes here from Mall of the Emirates, so public transport is a breeze, too.</p>

    Butterfly gardening is a way to create, improve, and maintain habitat for lepidopterans including butterflies, skippers, and moths.</p> <p>[2] Butterflies have four distinct life stages—egg, larva, chrysalis, and adult. In order to support and sustain butterfly populations, an ideal butterfly garden contains habitat for each life stage.</p>

    Butterfly larvae, with some exceptions such as the carnivorous harvester (Feniseca tarquinius), consume plant matter and can be generalists or specialists. While butterflies like the painted lady (Vanessa cardui)[3] are known to consume over 200 plants as caterpillars, other species like the monarch (Danaus plexippus),[4] and the regal fritillary (Speyeria idalia)[5] only consume plants in one genus, milkweed and violets, respectively.
    
    As adults, butterflies feed mainly on nectar, but they have also evolved to consume rotting fruit, tree sap, and even carrion.[6] Supporting nectarivorous adult butterflies involves planting nectar plants of different heights, color, and bloom times. Butterfly bait stations can easily be made to provide a food source for species that prefer fruit and sap. In addition to food sources, windbreaks in the form of trees and shrubs shelter butterflies and can provide larval food and overwintering grounds.[7] "Puddling" is a behavior generally done by male butterflies in which they gather to drink nutrients and water and incorporating a puddling ground for butterflies will enhance a butterfly garden.[8][9] While butterflies are not the only pollinators, creating butterfly habitat also creates habitat for bees, beetles, flies, and other pollinators.[7]</p>
